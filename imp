Freya the Frog is traveling on the 2D coordinate plane. She is currently at point (0,0)
 and wants to go to point (x,y)
. In one move, she chooses an integer d
 such that 0≤d≤k
 and jumps d
 spots forward in the direction she is facing.

Initially, she is facing the positive x
 direction. After every move, she will alternate between facing the positive x
 direction and the positive y
 direction (i.e., she will face the positive y
 direction on her second move, the positive x
 direction on her third move, and so on).

What is the minimum amount of moves she must perform to land on point (x,y)
?

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long
#define ANUJ_CODE ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(nullptr);

void fun() { 
    int x,y,k;
    cin>>x>>y>>k;
    int ans = max((x+k-1)/k , (y+k-1)/k);
    cout<<ans;
}

int main() {
    ANUJ_CODE
    int q;
    cin >> q;
    while (q--) {
        fun();
    }
    return 0;
}
